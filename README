This is an Apache handler to generate/handle ETags for dynamic content.

This project was called off before I tested the module, as our upstream CDN
provider (CloudFlare) doesn't support propagating ETags when using gzip at the
moment, so this is totally untested.

If you actually use this/write test cases for it, please let me know, and I'll
integrate them.
